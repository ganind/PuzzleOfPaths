#### Instructions

Given a two dimensional array representing a map, find the total number of paths between two opposite points (0,0) and (N-1,M-1). You can only move from left to right and from top to bottom. Value 0 means that you are free to go on a cell, value 1 is a non reachable cell.

* Entrée

Line 1 : An int M for the number of rows. <br>
Line 2 : An int N for the number of cols. <br>
M next lines: ROW A String representing the values of the cells of the row : 0 for an empty cell or 1 for a wall.

* Sortie

Line 1 : An int representing the number of paths between the two opposite points of the map.

* Contraintes

1 ≤ M ≤ 10 <br>
1 ≤ N ≤ 10
